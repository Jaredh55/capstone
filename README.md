# World Travelers Collective

This repository contains code for my capstone project within the Actualize curriculum. This is an application that allows users to share travel advice and experiences with others by posting images, content, and maps including GPS coordinates, and allowing chats with other users, votes, and comments on posts, among other features. The backend of the app was built using Ruby on Rails, and the frontend using VueJS.
